# TextAnalysis
This project takes a text as an input and analyzes it to return a [Flesch-Kincaid readability score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesch%E2%80%93Kincaid_readability_tests) value. Using a dictionary of words and syllables, according to the formula linked prior, the program is able to determine the text's FK score, and by that, its reading level. The program then compares its estimate to the actual FK score, in order to improve itself.

## How to run
Input the desired text to data/Texts
Compile and run the Readability class, found in src.
